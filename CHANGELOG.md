## [2.0.0-RC1] Release candidat - 2020-03-26

### Added
- Geometric and geographic entities implements JsonSerialization.

## [2.0.0-RC0] Release candidat - 2020-03-18

### Added
- A new documentation hosted on ReadTheDocs.
- Adding support of PHP7.2, PHP7.3, PHP7.4,

- Spatial function implementing the ISO/IEC 13249-3:2016 or [OGC Standard](https://www.ogc.org/standards/sfs) are now stored in the [Standard](./lib/CrEOF/Spatial/ORM/Query/AST/Functions/Standard) directory.
- Specific spatial function of the PostgreSql server are now store in the [PostgreSql](./lib/CrEOF/Spatial/ORM/Query/AST/Functions/PostgreSql) directory.
- Specific spatial function of the PostgreSql server are now store in the [MySql](./lib/CrEOF/Spatial/ORM/Query/AST/Functions/MySql) directory.
- Code coverage is now really at 90 percent. (CreOf code coverage was not valid because of AST functions which contained only properties),
- AST Functions updated to avoid misconfiguration (some properties was missing),
- AST Functions updated to detect which function was not tested,
- A lot of spatial functions,
- A lot of PostgreSql functions,

- Geometry and Geography platform classes unified in single class for each database platform.
- Class OrmTest renamed to OrmTestCase.
- Refactor single use methods in AbstractGeometryType into calling method.
- Include all test by default so tests are inadvertently skipped.

### Removed
- Static exception messages from package exception classes.

- Dependency on creof/geo-parser.
- Dependency on creof/wkt-parser.
- Dependency on creof/wkb-parser.
- Additional spatial functions support for PostgreSQL/PostGIS.

### Changed
- Replace regex in AbstractPoint with parser from creof/geo-parser.
- Use parser from creof/wkt-parser in AbstractPlatform class.
- Use parser from creof/wkb-parser in AbstractPlatform class.

### Added
- Change log file to chronicle changes.
- Stub TODO.md file.
- CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines.
- CrEOF\Spatial\Tests\OrmTest class to remove dependency on doctrine/orm source for tests.
- Travis-CI repo hook and configuration.
- CodeClimate config.

- Test config flag "opt_use_debug_stack" to use custom stack which logs queries.
- Numerous SQL/DQL functions for both PostgreSQL and MySQL.

- MultiPolygon geometry DBAL type.

### Changed
- Minimum doctrine/orm version now 2.3.
- All ORM tests now extend CrEOF\Spatial\Tests\OrmTest.
- Specifying test platform through @group annotation has been deprecated. Tests now configure supported platforms in setUp(), unsupported tests are skipped.
- Cleaned up existing test classes.
- Replaced rhumsaa/array_column dev package dependency with ramsey/array_column. Prior has been abandoned and is no longer maintained.
- Tests now pass string values to parameters instead of objects to avoid issues with field value conversion.
- Documentation split up into multiple files.
