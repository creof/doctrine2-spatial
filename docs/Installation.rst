Installation
============

Installation via composer
-------------------------

Add the `creof/spatial2-doctrine` package in your composer.json.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer require creof/doctrine2-spatial

Or you can edit directly `composer.json` file by adding this line on your requirements:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "require": {
    	...
        "creof/doctrine2-spatial": "^2.0"

Be careful, the version 2.0.0 will only be available at the end of march 2020.

Installation without composer
-----------------------------

If you're not using composer, you can
:download:`download the library  <https://github.com/creof/doctrine2-spatial/archive/master.zip>`.
Then copy and paste the lib directory where you store all libraries of your application.
